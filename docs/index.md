# AuthEngine

**One identity platform for all your apps and organizations.**

AuthEngine is the shared front door for your software ecosystem. People sign in once. Your CRM, APIs, dashboards, and partner apps all trust the same identity — who the user is, which organization they belong to, and what they are allowed to do.

Built for operators who run **more than one application** or **more than one customer organization** and need login, permissions, and audit to stay in one place.

## Why central identity?

When every service builds its own login, permissions drift, secrets spread, and users juggle separate accounts. AuthEngine replaces that with **one system of record** for users, sessions, roles, and policies.

| Benefit | What it means for you |
|---------|----------------------|
| **One account, many organizations** | Users belong to multiple tenants with different roles |
| **Login with AuthEngine** | Browser and mobile apps use standard OpenID Connect |
| **Token validation for APIs** | Backend services verify sessions without sharing secrets |
| **Permissions in one place** | Roles and access rules defined once, enforced everywhere |
| **Policy per organization** | Each tenant chooses sign-in methods, MFA, and session rules |
