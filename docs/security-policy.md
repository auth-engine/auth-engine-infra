## Scope

**In scope**

- Authentication bypass, session fixation, privilege escalation
- OIDC/OAuth misconfiguration or token validation flaws
- SQL injection, IDOR, multi-tenant isolation breaks
- Secrets exposure in repository or default configuration
- Infrastructure misconfigurations documented in this project

**Out of scope** (use regular [issues](https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine/issues))

- Denial of service without a proven exploit chain
- Social engineering
- Third-party services (AWS, Atlas, Upstash, SendGrid, etc.)
- Upstream dependency CVEs already fixed — open a PR or Dependabot fix instead

---

## Safe deployment reminders

- Strong `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (32+ random bytes)
- Restrict EC2 security groups and RDS to the API host
- `/opt/authengine/.env` permissions `600`
- MFA for super-admin and platform operators
- Rotate credentials if ever committed or shared
