# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in AuthEngine. This guide applies to all repositories in the [auth-engine](https://github.com/auth-engine) organization.

**Tagline:** One identity for every app and organisation.

!!! tip "New contributor?"
    Start with [Quick Start](quick-start.md), then open a [good first issue](https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) when available.

---

## Before you start

1. Read [Quick Start](quick-start.md) and run the stack locally.
2. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine/issues) — avoid duplicate work.
3. For large changes, open an issue first to discuss approach.
4. Look for issues labeled **`good first issue`** if you are new to the codebase.

---

## Local development

### Full stack (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine-infra.git
cd auth-engine-infra/compose
cp env.local.example .env
# Set SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY (openssl rand -hex 32)

docker compose up -d --build
docker exec authengine-api auth-engine migrate
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| API / Swagger | [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) |
| Dashboard | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) |

### Backend only

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine.git
cd auth-engine
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
auth-engine migrate
auth-engine run
```

Requires Python **3.12+**, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Postgres, Redis, and MongoDB (or use Compose above).

### Dashboard only

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth-engine/auth-engine-dashboard.git
cd auth-engine-dashboard
cp .env.example .env.local
npm ci && npm run dev
```

---

## Pull request workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and branch from `main` (`feature/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`).
2. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change when possible.
3. **Test locally:**
   - Backend: CI lint/typecheck; run migrations if models changed.
   - Dashboard: `npm run build` must pass.
   - Docs: verify links if you edited `docs/`.
4. **Describe the PR** — what, why, how tested, `Fixes #123`.
5. Open against **`main`**.

---

## Code guidelines

- Match existing style (Ruff/mypy for Python, ESLint for TypeScript).
- Never commit secrets — use `.env.example` only.
- Update documentation here when behavior changes.
- Prefer small diffs; discuss large refactors in an issue first.
